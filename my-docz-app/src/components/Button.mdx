# Button

## General information

Buttons are used to:
- Do something on the page
- Should not change a url or redirect a user

## Basic usage

### HTML Button (Best choice!)

<Button>Close the hatch</Button>

#### Code Snippet:

```
<button type="button">Close the hatch</button>
```

#### Notes: 
- The `type` attribute should always be explicitly stated as browsers may handle the default type differently
- All accessibility traits and attributes (such as focus and outline) are inherent and is recommended

<hr />

### Input Button

<InputButton>Start the engines</InputButton>

#### Code Snippet:

```
<input type="button" value="Start the engines">
```

#### Notes: 
- If you're using this, why not just use a `<button>`?

<hr />

### Role=button

<RoleButton>Launch Rocket</RoleButton>

#### Code Snippet:

```
<span role="button" tabindex="0">Lauch Rocket</span>
```

#### Notes: 
- Peek at the code and see all the different styles and attributes you need to add to make this look like a button

<hr />

## Special usage

### Icon Buttons

<Button ariaLabel="More Information">i</Button>

#### Code Snippet:

```
<button type="button" aria-label="More Information">i</button>
```

#### Notes: 
- Buttons without visible labels must have an informative label for screen reader users
- Buttons of icons should have a title attribute with the same information as the aria-label so that users who are unfamiliar with iconography can also understand it's meaning
